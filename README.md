# Virtual-Coffee-Machine

This is the first program that i write with Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

How does the program work:
once you run it, the computer will prompt you tu choose one of the menu such as latte, cappuccino and espresso. After you pick one of them, the program will prompt you to insert the coins you have. Once you insert your coins, the computer will calculate your coins and do a transaction validation process. If your coin is enough or more, the computer will check the machine resources to make the coffee, and if its enough, you will get the coffee and the change. If your coins are not enough, the computer will refund it. You can check the machine resources by typing 'report' or shutdown the machine by typing 'off'.
